# talks
This repo is used to keep a track of the Talks of PyJaipur 

To give a talk on any topic , just create a new issue in this repo and you will be notified (the date when you can give a talk and venue and timing) accordingly . (for ADMIN, whenever a talk is delivered just close the issue )

This repo helps in maintaining talks and pdfs or slide that are used in talks , so that later on it can be accessible too .
